should the renderer initialise the graphics.
 - Takes a window and the api type it want's to init
  - or atleast some type of window data (so it won't have a dependency on the windowing library in future)
I don't think meshes should have the actual buffer on them, we can use stack allocators to make the allocations faster.

I think the window should be associated with a renderer, then that renderer renders to that window. 
If we remove the buffers ect. from Meshes then they can be submitted to any renderer.

Cameras no longer have render targets?
 - Only question with this is how to handle rendering to texture?


Summary:
Window: Does not initialise graphics context. Has getters to retrieve the information to do so
Render: Takes in window and api enum and initialises the context it needs
